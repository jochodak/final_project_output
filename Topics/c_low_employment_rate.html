                    disabilities either as to the type of position, or the salary. The latter is a
                    decisive factor for a person with a disability to take a job due to the fact
                    that undertaking the job might cause losing various types of benefits from
                    social assistance centres. Very often a minimum salary is equivalent to the
                    amount of a benefit. </li>
                <li class="- topic/li li">Workplaces are not adapted to the needs of persons with disabilities, because
                    they have architectural or transport barriers. Out of 56,000 persons with
                    disabilities who were registered as unemployed in 2020 one third lived in
                    village areas where public transport is often problematic. In this situation
                    commuting to work is a big challenge for these people. </li>
                <li class="- topic/li li">Employers are reluctant to hire persons with disabilities, especially older
                    people, even though it could give employers a number of advantages. For example,
                    if these were people who have a significant degree of disability related to a
                    specific medical condition, the employer could use a fourfold deductions and
                    save over PLN 8,000. </li>
                <li class="- topic/li li">Some employers treat persons with disabilities as cheap labour. They employ them
                    for the time of obtaining refunds and dismiss them after the end of employment,
                    after which they employ other people referred by the labour office. </li>
                <li class="- topic/li li">There is no consistent policy on the labour market regarding persons with
                    disabilities, which results in a low number of job offers for persons with
                    disabilities.</li>
                <li class="- topic/li li">Persons with disabilities are not professionally active. In the period covered
                    by the audit, more than 80% of people with certificates of disability were
                    neither working nor trying to find employment. </li>
                <li class="- topic/li li">Persons with disabilities have low or no qualifications. According to the data
                    concerning registered disabled persons, most of them have low qualifications,
                    i.e. basic education and little professional experience. Almost 25% of
                    unemployed disabled people registered in a Labour Office in 2020 did not have
                    any qualifications. About 63.7% had basic vocational and primary education. The
                    percentage of people with higher education (as at the end of 2020) is only 8%,
                    while nationally it is more than 30%. Their situation on the labour market was
                    also not facilitated by their age. More than a half of persons with disabilities
                    registered in 2020 were over 50 years old, and 14.5% were already 60 years old
                    or more.</li>
                <li class="- topic/li li">Employers are reluctant to employ persons with disabilities due to concerns
                    about health-related absenteeism caused by their disability.</li>

                    comparison with unemployed people without disabilities. In 2020, out of 9,380
                    registered persons, 1,881 were looking for employment from 12 to 24 months, and
                    4,327 for more than two years. </li>
