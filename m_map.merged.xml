    <conbody class="- topic/body  concept/conbody ">
        <p class="- topic/p ">Information regarding support from PFRON is widely available. Information regarding
            multiple deductions can hardly be found. What is the reason for that?</p>
        <p class="- topic/p ">Companies have to employ 6% of people with disabilities to be exempted from paying
            obligatory payments to PFRON. When this ratio is achieved there is no payment to PFRON
            and the company can apply for additional payment to the salary of a disabled person. </p>
        <p class="- topic/p ">The problem is that it may be hard to find proper employees to fill this 6% requirement
            of employing disabled persons, especialy if we consider big companies that hire
            thousands of people. It is particularly difficult to employ people with disabilities in
            manufacturing companies. Because of their disability, the occupational physician will
            not allow them to work. </p>
        <p class="- topic/p ">Until then, the employer has to make obligatory payments monthly for every person with a
            disability that is not employed by this company. For most of the companies these monthly
            payments become additional tax and these money are included in the budget.</p>
        <p class="- topic/p ">This is where a multiple deduction can become very handy both for the companies and
            people with disabilities. First of all, companies would need to find people with <xref class="- topic/xref " href="#unique_6" type="concept"><?ditaot usertext?>disabilities who have moderate or
                significant degree of disability<?ditaot genshortdesc?><desc class="- topic/desc ">Degrees of disabilities and classes of disabilities</desc></xref> and it is caused by a <xref class="- topic/xref " href="#unique_7" type="concept"><?ditaot usertext?>specific medical condition<?ditaot genshortdesc?><desc class="- topic/desc ">The list of the specific medical conditions used for a multiple deduction</desc></xref>. This
            way an employer can deduct triple (PLN 7,308) or fourfold deduction (PLN 9,744) from
            PFRON payments. In the latter scenario, this means that the employer will have to employ
            only one person, but he can deduct an amount as if there were 4 people (1=4). The
            company that hires 1,000 people instead of employing 60 people with disabilities would
            need to employ 15 people with a significant degree of disability to eliminate entirely
            payments to PFRON. </p>
        <p class="- topic/p ">If the company doesn't have to make obligatory payments to PFRON, can they apply for
            additional payment to the remuneration of a disabled person? </p>
        <p class="- topic/p ">In the above scenario they can't do that, because they employ 15 people instead of 60,
            which is 1.5%. Even though a multiple deductions counts a person as four people, the
            actual number of employed persons with disabilities is taken into account when
            calculating the employment indicator. </p>
        <p class="- topic/p ">It does not mean that the company can never apply for the support from PFRON. Now that
            they do not have to pay contributions to the fund and they have people with disability
            with no additional cost, they can focus on filling the remaining 4.5% gap and then
            applying for the support.</p>

                would be perfect for them and for the employer, as there would be no need to prepare
