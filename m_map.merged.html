            February 2022, there are around 3 milion people with disabilities in Poland. For the
            purpose of the labour market research, a person with disability is defined as a person
            who is at least 16 years old and has a disability certificate. According to the Supreme

            with disabilities, did not have a job or were not looking for one. In terms of the
            inactivity rate of people with disabilities Poland ranks fifth in Europe. In the years
            2010-2020, this indicator was in their case almost twice as high as for the entire

        <p class="- topic/p p">The problem is the high percentage (over 80%) of disabled people who are economically

    <div class="- topic/body concept/conbody body conbody"><p class="- topic/shortdesc shortdesc">Funding from PFRON vs. multiple deductions</p>
        <p class="- topic/p p">Information regarding support from PFRON is widely available. Information regarding
            multiple deductions can hardly be found. What is the reason for that?</p>
        <p class="- topic/p p">Companies have to employ 6% of people with disabilities to be exempted from paying
            obligatory payments to PFRON. When this ratio is achieved there is no payment to PFRON
            and the company can apply for additional payment to the salary of a disabled person. </p>
        <p class="- topic/p p">The problem is that it may be hard to find proper employees to fill this 6% requirement
            of employing disabled persons, especialy if we consider big companies that hire
            thousands of people. It is particularly difficult to employ people with disabilities in
            manufacturing companies. Because of their disability, the occupational physician will
            not allow them to work. </p>
        <p class="- topic/p p">Until then, the employer has to make obligatory payments monthly for every person with a
            disability that is not employed by this company. For most of the companies these monthly
            payments become additional tax and these money are included in the budget.</p>
        <p class="- topic/p p">This is where a multiple deduction can become very handy both for the companies and
            people with disabilities. First of all, companies would need to find people with <a class="- topic/xref xref" href="#unique_6" type="concept" title="Degrees of disabilities and classes of disabilities">disabilities who have moderate or
                significant degree of disability</a> and it is caused by a <a class="- topic/xref xref" href="#unique_7" type="concept" title="The list of the specific medical conditions used for a multiple deduction">specific medical condition</a>. This
            way an employer can deduct triple (PLN 7,308) or fourfold deduction (PLN 9,744) from
            PFRON payments. In the latter scenario, this means that the employer will have to employ
            only one person, but he can deduct an amount as if there were 4 people (1=4). The
            company that hires 1,000 people instead of employing 60 people with disabilities would
            need to employ 15 people with a significant degree of disability to eliminate entirely
            payments to PFRON. </p>
        <p class="- topic/p p">If the company doesn't have to make obligatory payments to PFRON, can they apply for
            additional payment to the remuneration of a disabled person? </p>
        <p class="- topic/p p">In the above scenario they can't do that, because they employ 15 people instead of 60,
            which is 1.5%. Even though a multiple deductions counts a person as four people, the
            actual number of employed persons with disabilities is taken into account when
            calculating the employment indicator. </p>
        <p class="- topic/p p">It does not mean that the company can never apply for the support from PFRON. Now that
            they do not have to pay contributions to the fund and they have people with disability
            with no additional cost, they can focus on filling the remaining 4.5% gap and then
            applying for the support.</p>

        <p class="- topic/p p">COVID-19 has changed employers' attitude towards remote work. It has been proved that
            workers' efficiency does not decline when not supervised all the time. Currently, it has
            become more acceptable that many employees may never show up at the company premises.
            These are the perfect conditions for employing people with disabilites, to whom health
            or architectural barriers could be obstacles making it implossible to work. Physical
            presence is not needed for performing jobs like an interpreter, an HR professional, a
            lawyer, a white-collar interviewer – these are all ideal jobs for telecommuters. In most
            cases, they don't need their employer to provide them with equipment to perform their
            duties as they can use their own and bill the employer a lump sum. The financial
            benefits for employers can be immense thanks to this solution.</p>
        <p class="- topic/p p">However, if a person with disabilities would like to <strong class="+ topic/ph hi-d/b ph b">work from the office</strong>, there
            are some things that need to be checked first. Employers can be scared that the company
            building may not be adapted to the needs of a person in a wheelchair. </p>

                <li class="- topic/li li">As part of the interview process, the employer can conduct a tour of the
                    building to check potential architectural barriers (including a toilet
                    inspection).</li>
                <li class="- topic/li li">It is worth to remember that not every “wheelchair user” needs to use an adapted
                    toilet. The candidates can assess everything themselves.</li>

                    exceed 100 kg.</li>

                to a possibility of using a multiple deduction. In such case, the employer wouldn't
                have to pay PLN 9,744 to PFRON each month. Due to employees’ condition, remote work
                would be perfect for them and for the employer, as there would be no need to prepare
                a workstation for a remote employee. </div></div>
